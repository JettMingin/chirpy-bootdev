# chirpy-bootdev
http server course from boot.dev
RESTful API written in Golang, users can register/login, and "post" blobs of text, like a twitter clone

using postgresql, goose for migrations, and sqlc for ORM-like capabilities

no docs, not really meant to be used for anything but I learned a lot about Go!
